    DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY: Win32Project1 project overview<br>
================================================== ======================<br>
<br>
This Win32Project1 DLL was created for you by AppWizard.<br>
<br>
This file provides an overview of the content of each file<br>
that your Win32Project1 application consists of.<br>
<br>
<br>
Win32Project1.vcxproj<br>
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated with AppWizard. It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, as well as the platforms, configurations, and project features selected in AppWizard.<br>
<br>
Win32Project1.vcxproj.filters<br>
    This is the filter file for VC++ projects created using an AppWizard. It contains information about the association between the files in the project and the filters. This mapping is used in the IDE to represent the grouping of files with similar extensions under a given node (e.g. CPP files are mapped to the "Source Files" filter).<br>
<br>
Win32Project1.cpp<br>
    This is the main source file of the DLL.<br>
